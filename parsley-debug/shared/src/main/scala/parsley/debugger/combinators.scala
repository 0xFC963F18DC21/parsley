  /** Attaches a debugger to a parser, returning a reference to the debug tree produced by
    * the parser's parse tree formed as it runs.
    *
    * Ideally, this is called on the highest level parser that you want to debug, as this combinator
    * will traverse downwards in the parser tree and attach debuggers to all the child parsers. As a
    * consequence of this, it is not really recommended to include debugged parsers as lower-level
    * parsers within your main parser, and rather to isolate their testing.
    *
    * Before running the parser, it may be advised to see if the current platform's implementation
    * of the debugger supports [[parsley.debugger.util.Collectors]], which allows you to input an
    * object or class instance containing parsers, in order to analyse it via reflection to assign
    * the names given to the parser fields / methods in that object to disambiguate the parser names
    * in the tree in a much easier manner.
    *
    * Without that, many parsers will appear as `packageanon` or similar, which can make the
    * debugging process much harder.
    * will cascade downwards and apply debugging as far down as it can.
    *
    * After instrumentation, you would run the instrumented parser first, then after the parser
    * finishes running on ONE input ideally, you would run the debug tree generator function in
    * order to acquire the debug tree.
    *
    * This tree can then be introspected manually in a (runtime) debugger, or passed over to one
    * of the GUI frontends in [[parsley.debugger.frontend]] in one of the extra companion libraries
    * for this debugger.
    *
    * It is recommended that you save the debug trees somewhere should you want to re-use the same
    * debugged parser, or if you want to use the same debugged parser as a child parser on
    * multiple parts of your main parser, make sure you use [[attachReusable]], as re-use of the
    * same debugged parser across multiple parent parsers will cause the different parse trees to
    * incorrectly merge in an undefined manner.
    *
    * A small warning: debugging an already debugged parser (via [[attachDebugger]] and friends) is
    * an undefined behaviour.
    *
    * See [[attachDebuggerGUI]] to automate the GUI rendering process after parsing.
    *
    * @param parser The parser to debug.
    * @tparam A Output type of original parser.
    * @return A pair of the finalised tree, and the instrumented parser.
