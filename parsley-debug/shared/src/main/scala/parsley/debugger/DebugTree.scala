/** The tree representing a parser's parse tree.
  *
  * Initially unpopulated, it will be populated with information regarding the parser, such as
  * what it is (if it is a primitive such as [[parsley.internal.deepembedding.singletons.Pure]],
  * or a user-defined named parser if names are collected) as the parser itself runs on some input.
  *
  * Any tree node will store the input it has parsed (or attempted to parse) as well as its
  * success state as a list of pairs representing the parse attempts the parser has tried.
  *
  * The pairs consist of the input that was attempted to be parsed, and a boolean representing
  * if that particular parse was successful.
  *
  * Although this trait is unsealed, it is not useful to make a subtype of this trait, as this
  * trait's sole purpose is to provide safe methods into handling the frozen trees produced by
  * the debugger.
